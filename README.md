## Description

This section organizes the code into functions for specific tasks like adding, updating, searching, and displaying data, this section promotes better code readability, maintainability, and the ability to reuse code components in different parts of the application.

## Features

Created functions for each task (adding/removing students, updating grades, etc.) to simplify the program.

-Search and Update:
Functions to search and update records by student name.

-Error Handling:
Handles invalid names, grades, and non-existent students.

## How to Use

- Ensure python is installed in your machine
